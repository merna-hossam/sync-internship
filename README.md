Task 1 :
The dataset contains 80 user responses, in the response_text column, to a therapy chatbot. 
Bot said: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else'. 
User responded. If a response is 'not flagged', the user can continue talking to the bot.
If it is 'flagged', the user is referred to help. 
We are going to predict if it is flagged or not according to users responses.

Task 3
Boston house price prediction
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price.
To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.

In this dataset, each row describes a boston town or suburb. 
There are 506 rows and 13 attributes (features) with a target column (price).
